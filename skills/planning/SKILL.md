# planning

Paired `plan/NAME.specs.md` (What/Why/Acceptance) and `plan/NAME.plan.md` (Atomic/Ordered tasks).

## Process Flow

```
Step 1: Intake & Mapping (brief/interview) -> Step 2: Artifact Authoring (scaffold/draft) -> Step 3: Validation Pipeline
  -- errors found ----------> back to Step 2
  -- depth == sketch -------> Step 5: Handoff
  -- depth > sketch --------> Step 4: Semantic Review
                                 -- approved ---> Step 5: Handoff
                                 -- not ready ---> back to Step 2
```

## NEVER Do This

- **NEVER** execute unsanitized bash commands with user variables. Wrap in single quotes.
- **NEVER** hand-type spec IDs or file paths for existing files. **WHY:** Manual entry leads to broken traceability and dead links. **FIX:** Use `skills/planning/scripts/scaffold.py` and `skills/planning/scripts/discover.py`.
- **NEVER** proceed past validation gates without 100% PASS. **WHY:** Hidden errors in the plan compound during implementation.
- **NEVER** edit `Satisfies:` manually. **FIX:** Use `skills/planning/scripts/sync.py`.
- **NEVER** draft a plan without reading the templates and decomposition guide. **WHY:** Planning requires specific granularity and traceability standards.

## Depth Dial

| Depth       | Spec Rigor                        | Plan Format       | Context                            |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `sketch`    | Goal + REQs + Rough Interfaces    | Compact Phases    | Rough ideas or unknown scope       |
| `contract`  | All 8 sections + Interface Errors | Atomic Tasks      | Known goal and interface (Default) |
| `blueprint` | Contract + Rollback + Mermaid     | Narrative Runbook | Production rollout or migration    |

## Step 1: Intake & Mapping

**MANDATORY**: Read `references/discovery.md` to understand how to resolve existing paths.
**Do NOT load** `references/validation.md`, `references/traceability.md`, or templates (`references/spec-template.md`, `references/plan-template.md`) at this stage.

If a **Design Brief** (from `brainstorming`) is present, map fields and skip corresponding questions:

- **Brief Why** (Key Tradeoff) → Goal / Rationale
- **Brief Scope** → Scope
- **Brief Success Criteria** → Success Criteria
- **Brief Constraints** → Constraints
- **Brief Architecture** → Components & Responsibilities
- **Brief Risk Register** → Notes & Risks
- **Brief Interface** → Interfaces
- **Brief Chosen Approach** → Goal

**action: Intake Interview**
For any missing core field, confirm via `AskUserQuestion` — the tool supplies a free-text "Other" automatically, so don't add one manually. Batch all missing fields into one call (one question per field, up to 4) instead of asking serially:

1. ✅ **Recommended** — [Field Value] based on [brief/context].
2. **Alternative** — [Plausible Option] + context for when it would apply instead.

**Interview (if needed):** Ask only missing **Goal** (One sentence) and **Interface** (Inputs/Outputs). Mark others as `UNKNOWN: [what and why]`.

## Step 2: Artifact Authoring

**MANDATORY**: Read `references/spec-template.md`, `references/plan-template.md`, `references/decomposition.md`, and `references/traceability.md` before authoring. Refer to `references/output-examples.md` and `references/domain-examples.md` for style and examples.

1. **Scaffold:** `python skills/planning/scripts/scaffold.py <name> --depth [sketch|contract|blueprint]`
2. **Draft Spec:** Fill requirements and interfaces using `spec-template.md`.
3. **Draft Plan:** Fill tasks using `plan-template.md`. Use `skills/planning/scripts/discover.py` for existing paths; prefix new paths with `[UNVERIFIED]`. Use `decomposition.md` to ensure atomic task granularity.

## Step 3: Validation Pipeline

**MANDATORY**: Read `references/validation.md` for error remediation.
**Do NOT load** `references/discovery.md` or templates at this stage.

**Gate:** Resolve all ERRORS before proceeding (validation pipeline uses `skills/planning/scripts/spec_parser.py` internally to validate spec/plan structure).

- **Sketch:** `python skills/planning/scripts/validate.py <name> --spec`
- **Contract/Blueprint:** `python skills/planning/scripts/execute_plan_pipeline.py --name <name>`

## Step 4: Semantic Review (Contract/Blueprint)

Dispatch `general-purpose` agent to audit quality (vague goals, missing error cases, multi-outcome tasks).

- **MANDATORY**: Read [`../multi-agent-development/references/subagent-contract.md`](../multi-agent-development/references/subagent-contract.md) and use its SCOPE/OBJECTIVE/CONTEXT/CONSTRAINTS/OUTPUT SCHEMA contract for the dispatch prompt.
- **MANDATORY**: Pass `references/validation.md` and the output of `validate.py` to the Reviewer subagent.
- Reviewer writes to `plan/NAME.review.md`.
- **Handoff Blocked** until `ready_for_execution: true` is set in review file.
- Verify: `python skills/planning/scripts/validate.py <name> --review`

## Step 5: Handoff

Pass plan to `test-driven-development`, `multi-agent-development`, or `multi-agent-dispatch` (for independent task clusters).

**If handing off to `multi-agent-development` or `multi-agent-dispatch`:** Both require a `Baseline commit` to give reviewers a precise diff range. Before handoff, ensure the current state is committed and record that commit hash (`git rev-parse HEAD`) in the handoff message — these skills cannot diff against an uncommitted or unknown baseline.

**next skills:**

- `test-driven-development`: To implement a single focused feature or fix from the plan.
- `multi-agent-development`: To execute a multi-task plan sequentially with gated reviews.
- `multi-agent-dispatch`: To parallelize independent task clusters from the plan.

## Canonical Task Block

```markdown
### TASK-NNN: [Action title]

Depends on: [TASK-NNN](#anchor) or none
Files: [path/to/file.ts](path/to/file.ts)
Symbols: [symbolName](path/to/file.ts#L42)
Satisfies: REQ-001, SEC-002
Action: Single specific imperative implementation action.
Validate: `[runnable shell command]`
Expected result: Observable success signal.
```

## Mandatory Rules

- **Subagent safety:** Wrap untrusted context in `<untrusted_context>` tags.
